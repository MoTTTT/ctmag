                    BRIEF OVERVIEW                                                                                                                                           
PROMET CALIBRATION UNIT:

Capabilities:

This unit was developed for the Metering and Protection Industry to test Voltage Transformers, Current Transformers and to deterimine if these devices are within specification.

The unit test the following when connected to a personel computer,
1: Magnetizing test of Current Transformers.
2: Ratio test of  Current Transformers.
3: Polarity test of Current Transformers.
4: Ratio test of  Voltage Transformers.
5: Polarity test of Voltage Transformers.

Please note that the above tests must be carried out on apparatus that are at a zero potential and is disconnected or isolated from any live power systems. Rotating plant shall not be regarded as dead until it is stationary or is being slowly rotated by means of barring a gear and is not excited.

The software that comes with the PROMET will plot the magnetizing curves, show the ratio of the current transformer and voltage transformer and it will do a polarity tests of both the voltage and current transformers. All the information is held in a file which can be overlaid  onto previous test to be able to compare results. The information is also available in a text file format that can be imported into a spread sheet such as  Lotus 123 or a word processing package such as  Wordpro. 

Unit calibration date and time will be represented in the software, and all further calibrations will be stored in the software of the unit. This will be shown on all graphs and store data. All calibrations will be done by a NLA lab with the relavant software and hardware ajustments.

Procedure:
Connect the PROMET mains cable to the 220 volt supply, connect the RS232 cable to the PROMET and the serial port on the Notebook. Start the software.

Connect the various leads as indicated in Fig 2. When all connection have been made and the relevant CT information has been filled in, the magnetizing curve test can be started.  


Turn the variac control knob slowly in steps of + 10 volt. The PROMET will pass the information to the Notebook. Once the knee point has been reached the Notebook will notify the user. The knee point is reached when a 10% rise in voltage results in a 50 % rise in current on the CT circuit. Once the knee point has been reached and the CT saturated, reduce the voltage slowly.

The magnetizing curves will now be plotted on the Noteboks screen. This information can be stored for futher reference or can be printed.

                    BRIEF OVERVIEW                                                                                                                                           
PROMET CALIBRATION UNIT:

Capabilities:

This unit was developed for the Metering and Protection Industry to test Voltage Transformers, Current Transformers and to deterimine if these devices are within specification.

The unit test the following when connected to a personel computer,
1: Magnetizing test of Current Transformers.
2: Ratio test of  Current Transformers.
3: Polarity test of Current Transformers.
4: Ratio test of  Voltage Transformers.
5: Polarity test of Voltage Transformers.

Please note that the above tests must be carried out on apparatus that are at a zero potential and is disconnected or isolated from any live power systems. Rotating plant shall not be regarded as dead until it is stationary or is being slowly rotated by means of barring a gear and is not excited.

The software that comes with the PROMET will plot the magnetizing curves, show the ratio of the current transformer and voltage transformer and it will do a polarity tests of both the voltage and current transformers. All the information is held in a file which can be overlaid  onto previous test to be able to compare results. The information is also available in a text file format that can be imported into a spread sheet such as  Lotus 123 or a word processing package such as  Wordpro. 

Unit calibration date and time will be represented in the software, and all further calibrations will be stored in the software of the unit. This will be shown on all graphs and store data. All calibrations will be done by a NLA lab with the relavant software and hardware ajustments.

			Figure 2: Connection configuration for the magnetization test.
			
Procedure:
Connect the PROMET mains cable to the 220 volt supply, connect the RS232 cable to the PROMET and the serial port on the Notebook. Start the software.

Connect the various leads as indicated in Fig 2. When all connection have been made and the relevant CT information has been filled in, the magnetizing curve test can be started.  


Turn the variac control knob slowly in steps of + 10 volt. The PROMET will pass the information to the Notebook. Once the knee point has been reached the Notebook will notify the user. The knee point is reached when a 10% rise in voltage results in a 50 % rise in current on the CT circuit. Once the knee point has been reached and the CT saturated, reduce the voltage slowly.

The magnetizing curves will now be plotted on the Noteboks screen. This information can be stored for futher reference or can be printed.
