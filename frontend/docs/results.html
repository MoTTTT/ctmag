<B>MAGNETISATION CURVE TEST</B>

<P>Activating the <B>Strart Mag Curve Test </B>button<B> </B>would initialise
the Magnetisation Curve Test. The Promet unit transmit sensor data via
the RS232 serial link to the application front end (see Test Setup). The
voltage and current readings for the respective channels are displayed
in the status textfield just below the menu-bar. Increase the applied variac
voltage to the CT being tested . When a kneepoint is detected the application
sounds a beep to indicate that the variac must not be turned any further
i.e. do not increase the applied voltage to the CT under test. Wait approximately
5 seconds for the CT to settle then decrease the applied voltage to the
CT (see the <B>Magcurve Test Procedure </B>document for a detailed description
of the test procedure). A second beep would indicate that the test is finished
and the resultant characteristic curve for the tested CT is displayed in
the <B>CT Magnetisation Curve Panel</B> with the kneepoint indicated as
the main kneepoint in the results panel. When the <B>Magnetisation Curve
Test</B> is running the start and phase assignment buttons will be grayed
out (deactivated) while the <B>Stop Test</B> button is ungrayed (activated)
for the purpose of stopping the test whenever the user feels fit. When
a test is completed the measered characteristic curve can be assigned to
one of the phases.

<P>If the <B>Mag Current Threshold</B> or the <B>Mag Voltage Threshold</B>
is reached the test would be aborted as a safety mechanism. The application
would sound a beep and the text displayed in the status textfield would
indicate that a threshold have been reached resulting in a failed test
situation. Immediately decrease the applied voltage to the CT to 0V.

<P><B>(CT) CURRENT RATIO TEST&nbsp;</B>

<P>Activating the <B>Strart Current Ratio Test </B>button<B> </B>would
initialise the <B>CT</B> ratio test.&nbsp; The Promet unit transmit sensor
data via the RS232 serial link to the application front end (see <B>Test
Setup</B>). When the current threshold for the Cp measurement is reached
(set in the Options menu item, <B>Current Ratio Threshold</B>) the test
is finished. While the <B>Current Ratio Test </B>is running the start and
phase assignment buttons will be grayed out (deactivated) and the <B>STOP
TEST</B> button ungrayed (activated) for the purpose of stopping the test
whenever the user feels fit. The <B>Current Ratio Test </B>measures the
relationship between the Primary and Secondary currents of the CT Transformer,
when the primary current reaches the specified threshold the test is finished,
the application would sound an end of test beep and a dialogue box appears
with a dual textfield:
<OL>
<LI>
measured current ratio (displayed as a ratio of measured primary to secondary
current) and,</LI>

<LI>
measured polarity (indicated as either Yes (correct)/ No (faulty).</LI>
</OL>
<B>&nbsp;</B>The measured results can now be assigned to a phase by selecting
the appropriate phase assignment button or ignored by selecting the <B>STOP
TEST</B> button.

<P><B>(VT) VOLTAGE RATIO TEST</B>

<P>Activating the <B>Strart Voltage Ratio Test </B>button<B> </B>would
initialise the <B>VT</B> ratio test. The Promet unit transmit sensor data
via the RS232 serial link to the application front end (see <B>Test Setup</B>).
When the voltage threshold for the Vp measurement is reached (set in the
Options menu item, <B>Voltage Ratio Threshold</B>) the test is finished.
While the <B>Voltage Ratio Test </B>is running the start and phase assignment
buttons will be grayed out (deactivated) and the <B>STOP TEST</B> button
ungrayed (activated) for the purpose of stopping the test whenever the
user feels fit. The <B>Voltage Ratio Test </B>measures the relationship
between the Primary and Secondary voltages of the <B>VT</B> Transformer,
when the primary voltage reaches&nbsp; the specified threshold the test
is finished, the application would sound an end of test beep and a dialogue
box appears with a dual textfield:
<OL>
<LI>
measured voltage ratio (displayed as a ratio of measured primary to secondary
voltage) and,</LI>

<LI>
measured polarity (indicated as either Yes (correct)/ No (faulty).</LI>
</OL>
<B>&nbsp; </B>The measured results can now be assigned to a phase by selecting
the appropriate phase assignment button or ignored by selecting the <B>STOP
TEST</B> button.
