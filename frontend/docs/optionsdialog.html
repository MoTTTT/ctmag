<B>OPTIONS DIALOG</B>

<P><B>SELECT COM PORT:</B>
<BR>Select either COM1 or COM2 for serial communications with the PROMET
sensing unit by means of radiobuttons. The default setting is COM1.

<P><B>SELECT MAGCURVE CHANNELS:</B>
<BR>Offers the selection of four probable combinations of voltage and current
input channels for the magnetisation curve test.
<UL>
<LI>
Vs - Cs : Vs = voltage channel , Cs = current channel</LI>

<LI>
Vp - Cs : Vp = voltage channel, Cs = current channel</LI>

<LI>
Vs - Cp : Vs = voltage channel, Cp = current channel</LI>

<LI>
Vp - Cp : Vp = voltage channel, Cp = current channel</LI>
</UL>
<B>DRAW UPSWEEP:</B>
<BR>Selection box option allows for the drawing of the characteristic curve
for the CT on both the upsweep and downsweep of the variac i.e. when the
injected current into the CT are increased until the magnetisation effect
reaches saturation point and then decreased so that the magnetisation effect
decays. The industry standard is to draw the characteristic curve and calculate
the kneepoint for the CT on the downsweep when the magnetisation effect
decays since this is inherently more stable than the upsweep. When the
upsweep drawing option is selected, both the upsweep and downsweep characteristic
curve would be displayed in the maincurve&nbsp; ("CT Magnetisation Curve")
canvas. If the curves are drawn real time, both would initially be drawn
in black. When the end of test is reached the curves would be redrawn with
the upsweep drawn in green and the downsweep in black. Note that when the
curve gets allocated to one of the three phases, only the down curve gets
redrawn in the "3 Phase CT Magnetisation Curve" canvas.

<P><B>DRAW REAL TIME:</B>
<BR>Selection box option allows for the real time drawing of the magnetisation
curve for the CT. The maincurve would thus be drawn in the "CT Magnetisation
Curve" canvas as the magnetisation curve test is being conducted. Note
that if the "Draw Upsweep" option was not selected then the real time drawing
would only commence after the kneepoint have been detected and the variac
is turned down, the injected current into the CT is decreased.

<P><B>REAL TIME DRAW AREA (10% - 100%):</B>
<BR>Specify the dimensions of the real time displayed curve in the "CT
Magnetisation Curve" canvas. The default is a 100 percent which implies
that the real time curve would be displayed in scale to the maximum settings
for the selected voltage and current channels for the CT Magnetisation
curve test. Adjust the selected value between 10 and a 100 percent to obtain
the best results when the real time drawing option is activated. If the
drawn real time curve is too small, decrease the value. If the displayed
real time curve is visibly cut-off, increase the set value.

<P><B>Cs FULLSCALE CURRENT (mA):</B>
<BR>Allows the user to specify the Cs channel fullscale current in mA (enter
an integer value). The user should review the Mag Current Thresholds when
he has modified the Cs fullscale settings.

<P><B>MAG VOLTAGE MULTIPLICATION FACTOR:</B>
<BR>Allows the user to enter a voltage multiplication factor for the specified
voltage channel of the magnetisation curve test. This multiplication factor
would be used in all displayed results of the magnetisation curve test.
The measured channel values displayed in the statustextfield (while test
are running), reflects this multiplication factor. This setting can be
entered either as an integer or floating point value.

<P><B>TIME OUT THRESHOLD (ms):</B>
<BR>Sets the time threshold for the serial communications port. If serial
communications are not received in the specified time period then the test
is aborted. The time period is specified in milliseconds(ms). The default
is 10000ms which is 10 seconds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B>MAG VOLTAGE THRESHOLD (V at sensor):</B>
<BR>Specify a voltage reading for the selected magnetisation curve test
channel at which the test would be aborted. Note that this is for a set
voltage reading measured at the sensor which&nbsp; implies that voltage
multiplication factors are ignored in this setting. If the Vs channel is
selected for the magnetisation curve test, the maximum sensor reading for
this channel is 500V and the operator wants the test to be aborted when
a reading of 495V is measured by this sensor then a setting of 495 should
be entered in the field irrespective of voltage multiplication factor settings.
If a voltage multiplication factor of 2.0 applies to this test then the
test would be aborted at a displayed reading of 990V for the Vs channel
in the status textfield (the status textfield displays the value for the
voltage channel with the voltage multiplication factor taken into account).

<P><B>MAG CURRENT THRESHOLD (mA at sensor):</B>
<BR>Specify a current reading for the selected magnetisation curve test
channel at which the test would be aborted. When modifying the Cs channel
setting, this setting should be reviewed to determine whether it is still
an appropriate setting. Note that this setting is in milliamperes.

<P><B>VOLTAGE RATIO THRESHOLD (V at Vp):</B>
<BR>This threshold determines when the voltage ratio test completes. Note
that it is only applicable to the voltage measured at the Vp channel and
that the specified voltage multiplication factors only apply to the magnetisation
curve test and not to the voltage ratio test.

<P><B>CURRENT RATIO THRESHOLD (mA at Cp):</B>
<BR>This threshold determines when the current ratio test completes. Note
that it is only applicable to the current measured at the Cp channel.

<P><B>OK BUTTON:</B>
<BR>Enter the settings displayed in the OptionDialog fields. If the entered
values do not conform to the specific criteria for the field the application
would revert to default settings. It is advisable to check the options
settings before running a test to determine if the accepted optionsettings
conform to expectations.

<P><B>CANCEL BUTTON:</B>
<BR>Ignore the current OptionsDialog settings.

<P>*When starting the application default settings are instantiated.
