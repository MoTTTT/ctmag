<LI>
New Test&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Ctrl + n> - Instantiate a new test</LI>

<LI>
Next Test&nbsp; &lt;Ctrl + e> - Instantiate a new test while maintaining
all the panel settings.</LI>

<LI>
Import Test&nbsp; &lt;Ctrl + i> - Open a FileDialog to allow a test to
be imported.</LI>

<LI>
Save Test&nbsp; &lt;Ctrl + s> - Short-cut to save the test to its currently
specified filename and directory. If no filename and directory have been
specified then a FileDialog is displayed.</LI>

<LI>
Save Test As&nbsp; &lt;Ctrl + a> - Open a FileDialog to allow a file to
be saved as a specified filename in a specified directory.</LI>

<LI>
Generate Text File &lt;Ctrl + g> -&nbsp; Open a FileDialog to allow a text
file of the magnetisation curve test to be saved. This file will contain
the general settings and the CT settings. The voltage and current data
points for all three phases as well as the main curve would be included
with the measured kneepoints indicated. This text file can be imported
into a spreadsheet such as Excel (delimited text file with the limiters
being spaces).</LI>

<LI>
Print Report&nbsp; &lt;Ctrl + p> - Open a TestReportDialog to allow a file
to be printed if so selected.</LI>

Links - Links to previously opened and saved tests. Currently not enabled.</LI>

<LI>
Exit&nbsp; &lt;Ctrl + x> - Exit the application, note that tests are not
automatically saved on exit.</LI>
