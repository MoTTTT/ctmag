<B>MAGCURVE TEST PROCEDURE:</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
The hardware must be set up as stipulated for the current transformer magnetising
test. Turn the variac control knob to 0V. Ensure that the CT to be tested
is demagnetised. Apply power to the variac. Select the "Start Magcurve
Test" option on the application screen. In the statustextfield just below
the menu-bar at the top of the screen, the voltage and current readings
for the respective channels as measured by the Promet sensing unit will
be displayed.</LI>

<LI>
Increase the variac voltage at a constant tempo of 10V/sec (make use of
the voltage dial on which the variac control knob is mounted as a reference
in order to maintain a constant turning rate). When a kneepoint is detected
on the up sweep of the variac, the application notifies the user by sounding
a beep.</LI>

<LI>
Stop turning the variac control knob i.e. stop increasing the applied voltage
to the CT being tested.</LI>

<LI>
Wait 5 seconds for the CT to settle before proceeding with the down sweep
i.e. turning the variac control knob down to 0V.</LI>

<LI>
Start the down sweep very slowly and increase the speed to a maximum of
10V/sec. Try to maintain a constant sweep at this rate, do not exceed this
maximum speed.</LI>

<LI>
A second beep will indicate that the end of test has been reached. The
magnetisation curve for the CT under test would be drawn on the "CT Magnetisation
Curve" panel. The measured kneepoint for this curve will be indicated as
a voltage and current reading in the "MagCurve Results" panel assigned
to the "main kneepoint".</LI>

<LI>
This "maincurve" can now be assigned to one of the three phases by selecting
"RED", "WHITE"&nbsp; or "BLUE". To ignore this curve i.e. not assign it
to one of the phases, select the "STOP TEST" button. By assigning the maincurve&nbsp;
to one of the phases, the curve is redrawn for the selected phase in the
"3 Phase CT Magnetisation Curve" panel and its calculated kneepoint assigned
to the appropriate phase in the "Mag Curve Results" panel.</LI>
</UL>
<B>CURVE CHARACTERISTICS:</B>

<P>The magnetisation effect in a CT has a settling time. The magnetising
curves in the application are drawn on the down sweep of the variac since
the measured results for a CT are inherently more stable on the down sweep.
In tests conducted stable, accurate results were achieved when the up sweep
was maintained at a constant rate of 10V/sec, followed by a waiting period
of 5 seconds to allow the CT magnetisation effect to settle before proceeding
with the down sweep. The down sweep is slowly increased to a maximum turning
rate of 10V/sec.

<P>Since settling time will differ from CT to CT, it is advisable to conduct
a series of tests on a reference CT in order to achieve the correct, maximum
continious sweep speed. The results for the tests conducted on the same
CT should be identical. If the curves for the same CT do not match it is
indicative of inconsistant and incorrect sweep speeds. Sweeps which are
too fast would tend to flatten the drawn curve. If the angle of the magnetisation
curve differ for the tests conducted on the same CT it is a clear indication
of inconsistent sweep speeds between the different tests conducted. If
there is a difference in the highest voltage measured it would indicate
that the up sweeps were inconsistent, the up sweeps were too fast and/or
not enough settling time were allowed. Differences in the maximum current
measured indicate that the variac was not consistantly stopped at the sounding
of the first beep which could be indicative of too fast sweep speeds. Slower
sweep speeds are advised if results remain inconsistent.
