<B>VT (Voltage Transformer) TAB PANEL</B>

<P><B>VT</B> <B>MAKE</B>:
<BR>Choices are displayed and can be selected. If the make is not in the
selection then the relevant entry could be entered into the <B>VT</B> combobox
text field.

<P><B>TYPE</B>:
<BR>Choices are displayed and can be selected. If the make is not in the
selection then the relevant entry could be entered into the <B>Type</B>
combobox text field.

<P><B>CLASS</B>:
<BR>Choices are displayed and can be selected. If the make is not in the
selection then the relevant entry could be entered into the <B>Class</B>
combobox text field.

<P><B>PHASE</B>:
<BR>Make a selection of the choices available e.g. three-phase four-wire.

<P><B>DESCRIPTION</B>:
<BR>Editable text field in which the user can enter descriptive information
about the relevant transformer.

<P><B>SERIAL</B> <B>NO</B>:
<BR>Enter the transformer serial number into the text field.

<P><B>IL</B>:
<BR>Editable text field where the user can enter the <B>IL</B> number for
the transformer indicating the break down voltage <I>etceteras</I> of the
transformer.

<P><B>RATIO</B>:
<BR>The Ratio text field area is divided into two separate entries:

<P>The primary to secondary winding ratio of the voltage transformer would
be entered into a dual text field with the primary windings entered as
an integer value into the first text field and the secondary windings into
the second text field.

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>It's important for both values to be entered so that the
percentage winding ratio error can be calculated.&nbsp; It is to be expected
that the same turns ratio apply to all three phases in the test set. Although
it is possible to change the expected ratio for each of the 3 phases resulting
in accurate calculations for each of the phases, only the last entered
ratio would be saved for the test set resulting in erroneous results when
this test is imported again.

<P><B>VA</B> <B>RATING</B>:
<BR>Enter the Power (Voltage Ampere) rating of the transformer into the
text field.
