<P><B>MAIN CURVE GRAPH</B>
<BR>When the magnetisation curve test is completed, a magnetisation curve
is drawn. This curve represents the relationship between the measured current
and voltage readings for the <B>CT </B>(Current Transformers) under test,
the magnetisation curve kneepoint is displayed in the results panel.

<P><B>THREE PHASE CURVE</B>
<BR>Once a <B>Magnetisation Curve Test </B>have been completed it will
be displayed in the maincurve graph (<B>CT Magnetisation Curve</B>). This
curve can be assigned to one of three phases and when assigned the main
curve graph is redrawn in the three-phase curve graph canvas (<B>3 Phase
CT Magnetisation Curve)</B>, with the drawn curve set to the colour of
the selected phase.
