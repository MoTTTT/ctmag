<B>THE MAGNETISATION CURVES</B>

<P><B>MAIN CURVE :</B>

<P>Depending on the OptionsDialog settings a magnetisation curve is drawn
either real time while the magnetisation curve test is being conducted
or only once when the test is completed. An OptionsDialog setting also
allow for the up-curve to be drawn i.e. the characteristic curve for the
CT while the injected current is being increased, the core is being magnetised.
In correlation with the industry standard the kneepoint is calculated on
the down curve i.e. when the injected current is being decreased, the CT
core is being de-magnetised. Once the test is completed, the down curve
would be resized and drawn in black. If the "Draw Upsweep" was selected
the up curve would be drawn in green. The calculated magnetisation curve
kneepoint is displayed in the results panel.

<P><B>THREE PHASE CURVE:</B>

<P>Once a <B>Magnetisation Curve Test </B>have been completed it will be
displayed in the maincurve graph (<B>CT Magnetisation Curve</B>). This
curve (down curve) can be assigned to one of three phases and when assigned
it is redrawn in the three-phase curve graph canvas (<B>3 Phase CT Magnetisation
Curve)</B>, with the drawn curve set to the colour of the selected phase.
