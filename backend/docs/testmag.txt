Main CPU board:		
                     	Test:
				Program A/D, RS232 comms at 9600 baud.
				Do the necessary hardware configuration to
				test A/D and RS232 comms.
				CPU remains in reset mode.

			Debug:	
				DS1232 chip faulty, reset constantly set.
				R14 (100R) not inserted.

				Replace DS1232 IC with DS1232 from BHC board.
				Place R14 on board.

				Board operational and D/A and RS232 software
				fully portable using large memory model. D/A
				converters are working correctly (channels 0-3).
 

RS232 board			
			Test:
				RS232 comms tested O.K. at 9600 baud.

Test software
                        Test:
                                Test the A/D channels and RS232 comms. Approx.
                                5% corruption of data Tx.
    
                        Debug:
                                Serial buffer overflow. A/D conversions faster
                                than the RS232 can Tx, result in corruption of
                                data in the circular Tx buffer. Wait until Tx
                                buffer empty, indicated by clearing of the s_run
                                flag before starting a next A/D conversion.
